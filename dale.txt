To reimplement Git on this repository and start with a clean history, follow these steps in the command prompt from the project root directory (e:/MCP/scraper-mcp/scraper-mcp). This will remove the existing Git history and initialize a new repository.

1. Remove the existing .git directory (this deletes all Git history):
   rmdir /s /q .git

2. Initialize a new Git repository:
   git init

3. Add all files to the staging area:
   git add .

4. Create the initial commit:
   git commit -m "Initial commit with clean history"

5. (Optional) If you had a remote repository (e.g., on GitHub), add it back and push:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main

Note: Replace the remote URL in step 5 with your actual repository URL. If the remote already exists or you don't need it, skip step 5. Ensure Git is installed on your system.
